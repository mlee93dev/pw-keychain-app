# PwKeychain (Code last updated 7/3/2018, README last updated 7/5/2018)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3.

## App Purpose

This is the frontend of the PwKeychain app. The PwKeychain app is a personal project that serves to practice the creation of a backend coded by NodeJS, and the accompanying challenges that comes with trying to connect a frontend to a backend. It is a simple version of a password manager such as Safari's keychain.

The Angular framework was chosen due to familiarity and continuing relevancy as of May 2018.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
